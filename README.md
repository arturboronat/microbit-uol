# Tutorial on BBC micro:bit at Informatics (UoL)

The [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) is a tiny programmable computer with a wide range of [hardware features](https://microbit.org/guide/features/) that we use to introduce prospective students to the joy of programming for the Cloud and for mobile platforms, including the Internet of Things.

## Tutorial

We are going to use the [Block language](https://makecode.microbit.org/blocks) and [Microsoft's MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#) for writing programs. Once the program is complete, you need to download it and flash it (transfer it to the microbit).

Below, we propose a small number of exercises to become familiarised with micro:bit.

### Flashing software to micro:bit

This is the process of transferring a program to a micro:bit. Let's get started with this [quick guide](https://microbit.org/guide/quick/), where you will learn how to develop a basic program and how to flash it.

:warning: Our machines run Windows 10 on a virtual machine and to see the micro:bit as a USB device in the file explorer, you'll need to follow two more steps:
1. Hover the mouse pointer over to top part of the screen and click on the USB icon that will show up. 
2. Select `ARM BBC microbit device`. After a few seconds, the micro:bit should appear in the file explorer. 

**Optionally**, you may want to learn how to use your smartphone to flash a micro:bit program via bluetooth. If so keep reading and follow the steps below, else jump to the next section:
1. Install the app for your handheld device from [here](https://microbit.org/guide/mobile/).
2. Open the app and pair your micro:bit with your handheld device.
3. Access the `MakeCode` editor from the app.
4. Using your file manager application of choice (`File Explorer` in Windows), drag and drop the file containing your program to the micro:bit. 

A more detailed tutorial on the use of this app, including videos describing how to pair a micro:bit can be found [here](https://microbit.org/guide/mobile/#og-app).

### Programming a micro:bit

Once you've practiced how to flash a program, let's get started with some small programs. We are proposing a list of exercises by order of complexity. If you don't have time to complete all of them during the session, keep exploring the resources at home!

For each of the exercises below, write the program using the `MakeCode` editor and flash it to your micro:bit:
1. [Display your name](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/name-tag): can you print `UoL` on the LED screen?
2. [Smiley buttons](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/smiley-buttons): learn how to interact with the micro:bit by using its buttons.
3. [Night night light](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/night-light/): learn how to modify the brightness of the LED screen. To start straightaway, click on [activity](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/night-light/activity) (don't forget to complete the challenges!).
4. [Dice](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/dice): combine maths with micro:bit's sensors in order to implement a dice.
5. [Coin flipper](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/coin-flipper): turn your micro:bit into a funny coin flipper.
6. [Rock-paper-scissors game](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/rock-paper-scissors): use the accelerometer to build the logic of this simple game, involving variables and choice making. 
7. [Temperature](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/temperature): turn the micro:bit into a thermometer. To start straightaway, click on [activity](https://makecode.microbit.org/lessons/temperature/activity).
